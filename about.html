    <h2>About Mana Pottery</h2>
    <p>Mana Pottery began as a small studio where a handful of artisans worked beside the river. Over time it grew into a collaborative atelier, but we never left the small-scale, hands-on approach that defines our work.</p>

    <h3>Long-form: Our heritage and craft</h3>
    <p>Pottery in our region has been practiced for centuries. The clay here has a particular texture: it holds form well and takes glazes beautifully. We honor these local materials and historic forms while designing functional pieces for modern life. From the wheel to the kiln, our workflow emphasizes slow making. We document every glaze recipe and batch so we can reproduce or tweak pieces and maintain high standards.</p>

    <h3>Programs & Workshops</h3>
    <p>We run seasonal workshops for beginners and intermediate students. You can learn wheel-throwing, hand-building, and surface decoration techniques. Workshops are limited to small groups to ensure a personal learning experience.</p>

    <h3>Gallery & Archive</h3>
    <p>We maintain a small gallery at the studio where selected works are displayed. The archive holds examples of forms that inspired our current line — traditional bowls, water jars, and ceremonial pieces reinterpreted for everyday use.</p>
