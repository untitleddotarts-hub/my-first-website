# Mana Pottery — Demo Website

This is a simple static demo website for "Mana Pottery" with the tagline "Where Hands Shape Heritage".

What’s included:
- `index.html` — Home / product listing and story.
- `about.html`, `deals.html`, `kitchen.html`, `garden.html`, `decorative.html`, `contact.html` — pages.
- `css/styles.css` — styles.
- `js/script.js` — product data (10 demo products) and client-side rendering.
- `images/*.svg` — placeholder product images.

How to view:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click the file or right-click -> Open with -> Browser).
2. Pages are static and client-side. No server needed for basic browsing.

Notes:
- The contact form is a demo and not wired to a backend.
- Product purchase is not implemented — modal triggers a demo alert. Contact Praveen (example email) to arrange orders.
